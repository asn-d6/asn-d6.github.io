title: "The Token Zoo is now open!"

We recently launched the [Token Zoo](https://tokenzoo.github.io/)!

The Token Zoo is a knowledge base of various published (and unpublished)
anonymous credential schemes and their properties. It might prove useful to
you, if - like me - you've spent months going through the vast anonymous
credential literature and you feel like you need some hand holding!
